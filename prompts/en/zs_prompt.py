    based on a common target word that appears in both sentences and the target word may be in a different

    with 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 where:
    
    1 means that the meaning of the target word in both sentences is completely different or unrelated.

    3 means that the meaning of the target word in both sentences is closely related
